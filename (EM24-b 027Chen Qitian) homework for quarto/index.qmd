# Welcome to my website!
Hello everyone, my name is Chen Qitian and I am delighted to introduce myself here.
I am 25 years old and I come from Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.
I graduated from Beihua University with a major in broadcasting and hosting arts, and now I am studying in Belarus to complete my studies better.
I hope to build my motherland well after returning home, and I hope to gain something this year.
I usually like to watch volleyball games, and my favorite athlete is Zhu Ting. I also like to travel, and I have traveled to 60 cities so far.
Please rest assured that my planning goals are very detailed, and I will realize my dream at Belarusian State University
